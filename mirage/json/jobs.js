You could run a design project from start to finish, but you nerd out when it comes to a specific craft like visual design or ethnographic research. You also value soft skills. For you, over-communicating and project planning are essential to any project’s success. Selling your designs is second nature to you, because you design with intent. And pretty deliverables mean nothing to you unless you ship a product that moves the needle.\n\nYou design fast — keyboard shortcuts are your poor fingers’ best friends. You know when to lean on existing patterns and when to create something fresh. And you understand the difference between innovating and copying. To you, perfectionism is a dirty 13 letter word that has no place in design.\n\nYou accept that most companies follow a wonky design process, and that’s why they need your help. You believe that teaching is actually the perfect way to stay up to date on your craft. You preach that user experience is more than just what you see on the screen. The most frequent word in your vocabulary arsenal is “Why?” You’re as good at understanding problems as you are at solving them. \n\nThis contract role may be performed from a remote location and requires a level of effort estimated at 40 hours per week.\n\n###Your Responsibilities\n\n* Own the end-to-end design process for your projects. \n* Facilitate discovery sessions with clients and stakeholders to define success, requirements, and strategy. \n* Actually interact with customers to research their tasks, pain points, and emotions. Use research to inform feature prioritization. Translate research data into digestible deliverables.\n* Create interaction design patterns in the form of user flows, wireframes, full color mockups, and interactive prototypes.\n* Sell your work — tell compelling stories when presenting deliverables to customers. Be comfortable in formal design presentations and impromptu feedback meetings with clients\n###Required Experience\n\n* You have a portfolio showing your design process for multiple digital products across different industries. \n* You have worked in an agile product development environment. \n​###Let’s Talk About Us\n\nModus Create is a Product Studio offering consulting services and SaaS products for strategic planning, design and and execution of web-based and mobile products. We work across multiple industries with Fortune 1000, ISVs, and startups to validate, plan and launch new products. Headquartered in Reston, VA, we are a bootstrapped team that has grown from 2 to 100 people in 26 countries in 6 years, committed to building the best product consulting firm on the planet. We offer a highly collaborative, autonomous and effective working environment. We love and believe in what we do. This is your chance to be part of building something great.\n\n###Why Work at Modus Create\n\n* Enjoy the independence to shape digital products \n* Never get bored. Work on different projects across different industries. Fitness, banking, corporate security, travel, real estate — you name it, we’ve been there.\n* Build products that people will actually use.

Lemma aspires to be that system.\n\nThe existing online learning systems merely absorb and refactor existing material with the goal of reaching a broader audience. We believe that there is a unique opportunity to completely rethink pedagogy to take advantage of the possibilities provided by the recent coalescence of web and other computer technologies. Yet, the technology is not the driver: pedagogy is. Pedagogy must shape the design of the system and dictate the proper choice of technologies to ensure a seamless student experience.\n\nRemarkably, replicating many of the elements of the perfect mentor-student relationship can now be implemented in a most democratic and meritocratic way thanks to the available technologies. One, however, must be willing to rethink the entire educational process from the ground up and to insist on high quality pedagogy adapted to the new media, on seamless technology that replicates many features of the dialogue, self-pacing, adaptive features of our unattainable ideal, and on making the system as comprehensive as possible a universe of educational content. Educators are waiting for a true learning system that will empower rather than constrain them. It is finally time to build it.\n\nLemma does not aim to replace educators. It aims to transform the dedicated educators from being lecturers to being mentors. It aspires to offer them a tool for dialogue with their students as well as a comprehensive universe of coherent and assuredly consistent high quality educational content. A tool that will employ all existing technologies to provide a seamless, flexible, adaptive and responsive experience for the student. A tool that that will enable the teachers to know their students’ strengths, weakness, tendencies, working habits, likes, dislikes, and aesthetic preferences at an unprecedented level.\n\n###Job Description\n\nLemma Inc., a transformative online learning system is looking for a front end Javascript developer to make the Lemma system work seamlessly and beautifully on all devices.\n  ","seo-description":"Lemma Inc., a transformative online learning system is looking for a front end Javascript developer to make the Lemma system work seamlessly and beautifully on all devices.","timestamp":1496592443292,"prettydate":"4 Jun"}},{"type":"jobs","id":"-KletSumbNuWTa6lL656","attributes":{"title":"Front-end Developer/Designer (US)","url":"https://www.knack.com/jobs/front-end#job-applications/apply2/5420897dd3385df425055419/","company":"Knack ","day":"03","month":"06","year":"2017","slugend":"front-end-developer-designer-us","slug":"03/06/2017/front-end-developer-designer-us","description":"Knack is hiring a front-end developer/designer! You’ll be an integral part of our product and engineering team focused on designing and building a world-class product.\n\nWe do things a little differently here at Knack, and that’s just how we like it:\n\n* **Flat:** we don’t have project managers or dictates from a CTO. Each engineer is lead on multiple projects and is expected to make major decisions.\n* **Autonomous:** our engineers own their projects, collectively determine technical implementation, and have the freedom to define how they can maximize their impact.\n* **Engaged:** our engineers think of their job as more than just 1s and 0s. Only by engaging with our product, our customers, and our team can they be fully equipped to do their best work.\n* **Remote:** to make this work our engineers are great communicators and are highly involved with hangouts/chat/discussions around both engineering topics and larger company issues.\n\nThis isn’t for everyone, but for the right fit this will be the definitive experience of your career. Our goal will be to ensure you are driven and supported to continuously grow and do your best work.\n\nWe’re looking for a strong track record of designing and building products. With that said, we’re not looking for a 100% match on experience or our stack. If you have a history of shipping solid work, we’re interested.\n\n###About the Job\nKnack enables anyone to build data-driven web applications. Your goal will be designing the experience of these applications: they need to be engaging, present data in new and elegant ways, and look fantastic on any browser and device.\n\n**What You'll Do**\n\n* Lead design and development on the client layer and user experience.\n* Develop a comprehensive HTML/CSS/JS framework for rendering web applications for multiple devices and themes.\n* Refine the application building experience that makes it a delight for our customers to use and extend Knack.\n* Consistently improve the speed, reliability, and data persistence of the Knack client application.\n* Evaluate new technologies and help determine opportunities to leverage these.\n* Work on implementing front-end Knack features.\n\nHow you’ll do this:\n\n* **Program:** ship code every day\n* **Contribute:** we want our engineers to make an impact on the Knack product. This means you're not just implementing features that have been specified to death. It includes developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities.\n* **Engage:** we have enough areas of need where we want to leverage what you're excited about and use that to make Knack a better product.\n* **Learn and grow:** we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and actively engage in chat to constantly teach and learn.\n\nYou won’t have a direct boss but will be working collaboratively with our current engineering team of 6, and with cross-functional teams on specific projects. You’ll also work closely with the founders, Brandon & Eric, on strategy and technical implementations.\n\nOur work is 100% remote. We use Slack, Trello, Google Docs and Google Hangouts to get our work done.\n\n###Our stack\n\n* **AWS** - we’ve drunk the kool-aid and use AWS across the board.\n* **Node.js** - APIs\n* **Solr** - data search\n* **MongoDB** - data persistence\n* **jQuery, Backbone** - our front-end is largely raw JavaScript, with some Backbone for models and routing. We’re open to exploring other frameworks.\n* **Github, Jenkins, Ghost Inspector, Mocha** - deployment and testing\n###About You\nAbove all, you build things. You have a history of starting --and completing-- projects, whether that’s products, applications, games, libraries, or plugins.\n\nYou’re both a teacher and a learner. You’re not afraid to admit when someone may know more than you. You have the confidence to help others level up.\n\nYou’re an outstanding communicator. You can document a problem, and clearly and succinctly outline a solution. You’re not afraid to distill things into plain English for teammates and customers.\n\nYou have experience working in fast-paced environments, prioritizing and balancing multiple projects, and working with cross-functional teams.\n\nYou want to work on a product you can be proud of that impacts thousands of people all over the world, from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies.\n\nYou go all in. You want to do your best work, and have that work make an impact.\n\n###About Knack\nKnack is a no-code platform that makes it easy for anyone to build applications and workflows to do amazing things with their data.\n\nKnack launched in 2012 and has been growing steadily as we’ve built our team, perfected our product, and nailed our product-market fit. We’re now ready to take things to the next level and maximize the opportunity for what this product can be.\n\nSo why are we different?\n\n**We’re bootstrapped:** we’ve had to build something our customers actually pay for. This changes how you do things.\n\n**We’re 100% remote:** and have been from the beginning. Every decision we’ve made has been based around optimizing our remote operations.\n\n**We’re small:** and we like it that way. We’re more than just chat avatars-- we’ve all gotten to know each other, have grown together, and love working with each other.\n\n**We enjoy the journey:** we’re in this for the long haul. We’re not chasing an exit or the next round of funding. We’re building something we’re proud of and want to keep improving on.\n\n[You can read more about Knack and the team here](https://www.knack.com/about).\n\n###Benefits & Compensation\n**Competitive salaries and generous equity:** rather than give up equity to investors to pay engineering salaries, we’ve chosen to give more of that equity to our team while still paying strong salaries.\n\n**Define your work:** our only rule is our overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST. Otherwise find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work. It’s not about separation, it’s about optimization.\n\n**Unlimited Paid Vacation:** take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. You’ll get forced days off for birthdays and knackiversaries.\n\n**Paid Corporate Retreats:** we get together twice a year at amazing locations to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals.\n\n**Learning Credits:** an annual allowance is provided to stay on top of your game with classes, books, and conferences.\n\n**HealthCare:** work in progress. We’ve recently reached team numbers that make offering plans to a remote team feasible and are in conversations with major providers to secure coverage in 2017.\n\n###How to Apply\nPlease note that we are considering US citizens only.\n\nIf interested, please include any social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) and answer the following questions:\n\n* Why would this be a great fit for you?\n* Where could you make the most impact?\n* How can we see some of your best work?\n  ","seo-description":"Knack is hiring a front-end developer/designer!

For the past 11 years, our customers have relied on our products as a critical part of their day-to-day operations. They’re the reason we’re still in business, and their needs drive our product decisions.\n\nHarvest started as a team of 3 and grew slowly to today’s current total of [51 lovely faces](https://www.getharvest.com/about/meet-the-team). Though we have an office in NYC, we hire the best people for the job no matter where they call home. We’ve worked as a remote team since the beginning, and we work hard to make sure everyone feels included and heard.\n\n**Design at Harvest**\n\nOur design team has a deceptively simple mission: build products that serve real world needs for people running businesses.\n\nOur approach to building a product has always been to talk with our customers, listen to their feedback and questions, and to distill that information to discover what our customers actually need. It’s a process that requires care, patience, empathy, and intelligence. Everything we’ve been able to do as a company for the past 11 years comes from designing usable features that serve our customers’ actual needs.\n\nThis approach has served our company well, but lately we’ve taken a step back to understand how we’re serving our own team. We have a small and productive group, but we believe there’s unlocked potential that we’re not doing our best to realize.\n\nThere’s space on our team for an experienced designer who is ready to embrace the challenges of being a leader and mentor. You’ll make the team better not simply by adding raw talent, but by getting the most out of everyone here. You’ll have a mandate to recognize and nurture our team’s strengths and to identify and improve upon its weaknesses.\n\nDoes that sound like you? If so, here are some of the things we’ll ask of you:\n\n* **Mentor our designers:** You’ll lead our designers and coach them through trouble. You’ll help identify areas for improvement and guide them on the path to get there. You’ll make sure we’re doing everything we can to provide a fulfilling design environment for our team.\n* **Improve our process:** We’ll ask you to think about the way our product team works, and make the process better. Once those ideas are implemented, you’ll evaluate changes for effectiveness.\n* **Shape the design team:** Once you’re familiar with the team you’re working with, you might find that roles could change slightly to better suit our needs, or that the team should grow. We’ll ask you to nurture our existing designers, and lead any hiring efforts so we have the right mix of people.\n* **Help us reach a broader audience:** We want to be better at showing the rest of the world the good work we do. You’ll help us do that!\n####REQUIREMENTS\n\nThese are the qualities we consider most important in a candidate:\n\n* Mentorship. You have a history of helping less experienced designers improve at their craft. You enjoy teaching and the good feelings that come from making the people around you better.\n* Emotional intelligence. You’re able to recognize when our team is stressed, frustrated, overworked, happy, etc–even if the team doesn't recognize this themselves! You find ways to encourage people when they’re down, motivate them when they’re stuck, and celebrate with them when they’ve succeeded.\n* Communication. You’ll have a substantial influence on how we communicate as a team and to the world beyond. As a remote-first company, we rely on the written word and you’re more than capable of sharing your thoughts and ideas in ways that are compelling, thorough, and hopefully a little fun.\n* Experience. The saying “those who can’t, teach” doesn’t apply here. We’re looking for someone who has a history of seeing their product work out in the world.\n* Pragmatism. You make decisions because you believe they’ll work for the situation at hand – not because a solution is trendy or has worked for you in the past.\n* Respect. We all come to the table with different worldviews and experiences, but we can debate ideas because we share the goal of shipping the best possible solutions.\n* Humor. We try to have fun together because, after all, it’s just a job.\n\n\n**When you Apply**\n\n* Tell us why working at Harvest appeals to you and what you’ll bring to the team.\n* Tell us about a recent project that made you happy and proud.\n* Show us something!\n  ","seo-description":"Harvest is an independent software company that makes tools to help businesses run more smoothly.

From constructing intuitive search to stunning visualizations and making sophisticated reports, AgFlow aims to provide great interfaces for understanding complex agriculture domain in simple steps and making this extracted knowledge easily accessible. Aggregated data by AgFlow is skyrocketing such that new data types are analyzed quarterly, new data sources are acquired weekly in addition to increase in the amount of data from each data source.\n\n###You might work on:\n* The new version of AgFlow's single page application. It's not enough to navigate/analyze rich set of data in terms of intuitiveness, responsiveness and supported browsers\n* Mobile application. In trading, having correct information timely is vital so our users should be able to access platform with their mobile devices.\n* Widgets. AgFlow has powerful backend system to crunch huge amount of data to summarize multiple complex parameters to a few simple numbers. Goal is to make this inference pluggable into different places.\n* Vast array of internal tools, including AgFlow admin, used across teams to manage/investigate price, trade flow, freight data, and AgFlow inference, where AgFlows go to learn about high level inferences, domain coverage and quality of comparisons to predictions/actual government numbers.\n###You might be a fit for this role if you:\n* Can empathize with the many different types of users who use AgFlow’s UIs\n* Enjoy building UIs with modern tools like ES6, React, Redux, PostCSS, Flow, and Webpack\n* Can think through quickly changing customer requirements to come up with high-impact ways of quickly solving their problems\n* Care deeply about performance, accessibility, and API design\n* Have a high bar for quality of code and quality of user experience\n* Are comfortable working in a large frontend codebase with many stakeholders\n* Care about the details\n###What's it like to work at AgFlow\nAgFlow is helping to make agricultural knowledge online, understandable and to be easily acted on. This domain's very similar to credit card business where there are a few companies, whom everybody is afraid to compete with, On the other hand, they are highly inefficient and very expensive. AgFlow disrupts this domain by making it efficient and relatively very cheap.\n\nAgFlow is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core agriculture market knowledge, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills and backgrounds - from reliably handling of acquisition of data from different mediums (API, CSV, EXCEL, PDF, HTML scraping), cleaning and normalizing data into one carefully designed model, making inferences by learning from it and creating interfaces to enable everybody to take knowledgeable decision in the market.\n\nDue to domain complexity, AgFlow is working with multiple domain experts. Developers are always in contact to discuss ins and outs of each feature with them. This benefits developers to learn details of trade and agriculture.\n\nWe use a lot of open source projects but unfortunately we can't contribute back as much as we want due to limitation of resources but you can be a part of change in this direction.\n\nWe look at AgFlow as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.\n\nWe encourage all engineers to transition teams to take short-term projects or to take personal initiatives to connect data sources creatively. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of AgFlow work while also establishing stronger ties and cross pollination between groups.\n\nWe want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other AgFlows in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do). We also have a culture of transparency that we care with utmost priority.\n\n###You should include these in your application:\n* A short introduction describing who you are and what you’re looking for. What projects have you enjoyed working on? Which have you disliked? What motivates you?\n* Links to online profiles you use (GitHub, Stackoverflow, Twitter, etc).\n* A description of your work history (whether as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose).\n\nOur culture and this write-up are inspired by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)\n###How to apply\n\n[jobs@agflow.com](mailto:jobs@agflow.com)","seo-description":"AgFlow is hiring a Frontend Developer.","timestamp":1494438444584,"prettydate":"10 May"}},{"type":"jobs","id":"-KjnRzUAcfslDp9PGMIY","attributes":{"title":"Senior Front-end Developer (-1/+1 hour CET)","url":"https://weworkremotely.com/jobs/4711-senior-front-end-developer","company":"Conferize","day":"10","month":"05","year":"2017","slugend":"senior-front-end-developer-11-hour-cet","slug":"10/05/2017/senior-front-end-developer-11-hour-cet","description":"We are a fast growing startup, building an awesome product.

We love creative thinkers and selfstarters, who never wait to be told what to do.\n\nWe believe in a flat bottom-up organization of work where culture trumps policy.

We live in a world of screens, and we are the ones who decide what goes on them. We are in a unique position to have an impact one that lasts longer than the next redesign or the latest technology. What happens when we stop thinking of ourselves not just as developers or experience designers, and take up the mantle as a new generation of product designers for a digital world? - Attributed to Marshall McLuhan (but John Culkin deserves a shout out too!)\n\nIf you think creating the future and shaping our environment sounds interesting, and you want to work on technology that touches us in our daily lives (wearables, IOT, mobile), you might be a good fit here.\n\nIf you are like us, you believe that design goes much deeper than the medium or the technology. Design is the process of envisioning the future and playing a role in creating it. Its a process that never ends. You probably have sketches and half-built projects here and there for how to improve all kinds of things that don't meet your standards (hopefully for both of our sakes, you also have some finished work!)\n###REQUIREMENTS\n\n**Why should I join this company?** \n\nYou should join us if you want a bureaucracy-free and consequence-oriented environment in which we pursue product quality, not zombie metrics or certifications in this or that methodology. At Mokriya, we seek the best designers and engineers, give them the autonomy we believe creativity requires (and the equipment they want), and evaluate based on impact, not politics.\n\nWe don't fall for fads and we don't rely on hype or empty rhetoric; we are a real, profitable business that's growing every month, and we believe there's an awesome future ahead. If you love to build things of quality and want to be surrounded by bright folks and given the resources you need to thrive, Mokriya might be a place for you.\n###BENEFITS\n\n**Why should I be excited to work here?** \n\nFirst, its fun. Not in the everyone pretend to have fun, were a startup, where are the Nerf guns? way, either. Its fun to work at Mokriya because beyond the perks and good times, were a happy team of people who love to design and build great products. Its not just that we have an awesomely flat organizational structure in which everyone is *really* empowered to act; its also that we hire for fit and bring folks on only if were confident in their integrity, capability, and drive.\n\nNo one will watch over your shoulder, but neither will you have to watch over anyone else's; were a talented team of doers. There's little bureaucracy and no blocking; we work to make sure you can get things done in the way that best suits your preferences and the project needs.And when people have autonomy, room to be creative and reflective, are rewarded well for great work, and can trust and rely on their colleagues, it makes them happy.

It’s great stack to work with everyday, and we take our time to write solid code and proper tests to make sure it stays that way.\n\n###Dev Process\nWe do a fair amount of pair programming and a lot of code reviews, we love solid tests and continuous integration, and we deploy several times a week. Basically? We’re constantly improving our process so we can create an ideal developer environment - low overheads, high transparency. Estimates were inaccurate and irrelevant, so we dropped ‘em. Artificial deadlines weren’t doing it for us, so we switched from scrum to pure kanban and never looked back. When something isn’t working, we’re not afraid to throw it out and try something new - so if you have exciting ideas about the dev process and how to make your own job even better, you’ll fit right in. (We’re open-minded like that.)\n\nYou’ll have final responsibility for the solutions you build, from inception all the way through to deployment, so your teammates know exactly who to shower with praise when you ship to production.\n\n###About Us\nWe’re a small team of about 30 people, all working remotely across the US & Canada. We do a lot of collaborating and meme-swapping on Slack, along with virtual team meetings and super-futuristic video calls. We also do a twice-annual meetup week where we work together on cool projects all day and generally make fools of ourselves all night. We’re proudly bootstrapped and profitable, which means we get to turn down VC money a lot and keep doing things the way we like. We’re pretty serious about building and maintaining an awesome, positive company culture, so, you know, no jerks.\n\nWe'll probably get along if you’re someone who wants to be creative, have a pretty-serious-but-not-inhuman amount of responsibility, and work with people who make going to work not suck. (And be one of those people yourself. We like those people.)\n\nWe know we’re ridiculously lucky to have this crack squad of ambitious, kind, independent little nerds, and we want to keep that going by bringing in even more people who love geeking out about what they do and doing work they’ll be super proud of. (And on that note, we’re an equal-opportunity employer genuinely committed to building a diverse team, and to fostering the type of inclusive environment in which diversity thrives.)\n\nYou can find out more at [http://meetedgar.com/careers/](http://meetedgar.com/careers/)\n\n###Requirements\n* Senior level developer w/ at least 3 years experience\n* You’ve got real professional experience with React + Redux, and ES6 is a big plus\n* You know how to consume a REST API\n* Experience creating single page applications\n* Startup or \"greenfield\" experience is a big plus\n* Live anywhere in the USA or Canada (must be able to provide documentation of eligibility to work in the USA)\n* You love JS and React\n* You know how to communicate effectively and work as part of a team trying to build something great\n* Passionate about improving the dev process and recognize the value of an awesome company culture\n* Not a jerk\n\n###Perks & Benefits\n* Work from home (or wherever there’s strong wifi)\n* 4 weeks paid vacation (Shazam!

We require your expertise to work with team members on unique  designs for many different projects. You will have the opportunity to exercise your creativity to create clean, modern designs for web  and mobile applications and websites that help showcase the amazing user experiences that have become standard at Tesera.  \n\nYou will begin by meeting with the client to determine their needs for the mobile or web applications.

Our primary business lines are as follows:\n\nProfessional Services has always been a focus for Tesera.  We help our clients implement projects in areas such as open data, data management through visualization and analysis, data science, commercial product development and geospatial solutions.  In the past year our Professional Services teams have completed a variety of projects including building the SaaS platform for an award winning energy services asset management startup, building a set of citizen science mobile monitoring apps, building a new way to share environmental monitoring data, building a sophisticated automated data quality control pipeline for the forest sector, creating a portal for biodiversity monitoring data, and delivering a series of applications to support the Fort McMurray wildfire recovery.  Helping us build and expand this core service area will be your primary responsibility.  \n\nOur second business line is in the adaption to climate change space.  Tesera has worked with a key industry associations to build a risk assessment tool that will support and assist municipalities in discovering asset vulnerabilities.  Tesera is commercializing this product which employs a spatial machine learning approach.  We break the landscape down into thousands of spatial indicators which can then be modeled to determine their influence on event outcomes such as infrastructure failures.  We have a lot of work to do here to bring this to a commercial product offering and we are very excited about doing it.  \n\nHigh Resolution Inventory Service  (HRIS) is our third business area.  HRIS enables our clients who manage landscapes to have a higher level of resolution and accuracy that they’ve ever had before.  HRIS combines LiDAR, colour infrared imagery, climate indices, terrain indices and ground plot data via machine learning processes to predict attributes about the landscape.  The types of information that can be generated from HRIS are far-ranging from types and quality of timber resources to locations of streams, potential wildlife habitat and amount of carbon sequestration.  The HRIS solution, creates attributes across an entire landscape creating an inventory that has more useful attributes and is at a more detailed resolution than other approaches available today.  \n\n**OUR “PURPOSE” and** VALUES:\n\n**“We disrupt conventional thinking to expand what is possible.   We ignite change in the future we share.”**\n\n**Accountability:**  We hold ourselves, and each other accountable for all we do.\n\n**Communication:**  We communicate openly and honestly. We listen.  Each is heard and considered.  We share feedback and express gratitude.\n\n**Community:**  We contribute and lead within communities that empower and inspire us.\n\nDesign and Innovation:  We craft elegant solutions using beautiful ideas and innovation.\n\n**Fiscal:**  We are responsible for our fiscal health and vitality.     \n\n**Fun:**  We are the spark that triggers awesome.\n\n**Health, Fitness and Balance:**  Space-Time is ours to define.  We bend work to balance our lives.\n\n**Personal Development:**   We are driven to learn.

For eight straight years after opening our law firm we grew gross revenues 40% a year until well, we didn't. During this same eight-year period, we grew our payroll at about 40% to handle the increased volume. I told myself during this youthful time I was being a shrewd business owner and the reason I wasn't personally more financially successful was because I\n\nwas reinvesting the revenues into the business. The truth was I mistakenly thought growth would fix all our problems. In 2012 I woke up after seeing revenues significantly decline, not having enough money to routinely pay myself, and quickly realized our lack of systems was the real chokehold on our success.\n\nWith seven offices handling multiple practice areas I worked at a level of complexity that was exhausting. It isn't accurate to say our firm was without systems, but in 2012 we felt like a body builder who is all upper body with tiny legs. Our muscle was a well-developed marketing strategy, and our legs were the systems that supported the firm.\n\nIt took us two years to shore up our infrastructure with deep practice, expert advice, and solutions we borrowed from other industries. We attended multiple guru events, hired numerous consultants, and our audible business library grew quite large. What we learned was to fall in love with the process of systematizing. Why else write this? We love it. 80/20 is what it's all about. Getting a disproportionate return on your investment should be the reward of every improvement.\n\nWe continue to get guidance from several experts and do not claim to have all the answers. We share numbers with other law firms across the country and are committed to progress, not perfection. Asked if I want to grow like we did before, I would say no. Marketing and infrastructure go hand in hand. At whatever speed you can grow both together, make it happen. Disciplined Practices is about doing the right stuff consistently that continually builds momentum.\n\n\n  ","seo-description":"4iiz is seeking a front end UI developer","timestamp":1493314567170,"prettydate":"27 Apr"}},{"type":"jobs","id":"-KikSfyvm5sxn_Ioz7WV","attributes":{"title":"Front-End Developer (EU)","url":"http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/141531/front-end-developer-requirement-european-greenpeace","company":"Greenpeace","day":"27","month":"04","year":"2017","slugend":"front-end-developer-eu","slug":"27/04/2017/front-end-developer-eu","description":"###Job Description\n\n**This is a long term (3 months to 1 year) contract for 40 hours/week work.

You have no idea who has your contact information.\n\n\n###About Us\n\nWe are a stealth mode startup working on solving these problems. Our aim is to launch our first product in the summer of 2017. We are funded by a successful serial entrepreneur. We are working remotely with team members based in Cambridge, UK and Berlin, Germany.\n\n\n###The Role\n\nYou will join our team as our first Product Designer.
