Here’s how we do it.</div><div><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>We Practice Holacracy</b></div><div><br></div><div>We are one of the early adopters of Holacracy, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</div><div><br></div><div>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations. As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</div><div><i><br></i></div><div><i>\"Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.\"</i></div><div><i>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</i></div><div><br></div><div>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</div><div><br></div><div>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</div><div><br></div><div>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</div><div><br></div><div>Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</div><div><br></div><div>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</div><div><br></div><div>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Skillset Expectations</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the table:</div><div><br></div><ul>\n<li>Solid web development frontend skills in Javascript, HTML, and CSS, including ES5, JSX, Sass, and React.js.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Experience building and delivering React.js applications that have seen actual production usage.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Familiarity with building classic Ruby on Rails UIs (server-side rendered views) is a strong plus.<br>\n</li>\n<li>A sense of good UX principles (though you will not necessarily be expected to design. We have amazing designers on staff.)<br>\n</li>\n<li>Firm understanding of how to write secure frontend code and an awareness of common web application security vulnerabilities.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Testing and the ability to write unit tests/specs (we use popular Javascript testing frameworks)<br>\n</li>\n<li>Ability to prioritize and make decisions without needing to be micromanaged<br>\n</li>\n<li>History developing actual SaaS applications that have seen production usage with real customers.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Truly interested in giving our customers a great experience and able to communicate directly with customers and prospects</li>\n</ul><div><br></div><div>Most of our best applicants have Computer Science (or similar) degrees from a well-regarded university. Our best applicants also tend to have at least 3-5 years experience in a position with direct responsibility for developing and supporting large production applications.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Our Core Beliefs</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>We believe that everyone in tt everyone in the company should have programming skills. Our customers are primarily engineers, and in order to relate to them and support our products at the highest possible level, we should all be engineers too.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide variety of programming language experience. We don’t hire for specific programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who are fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be adaptable and ready to evolve to what’s next.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us access to great people we wouldn’t otherwise be able to hire. We tend to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually have their family established somewhere. By offering remote work, we can hire the best people, no matter where they’re located.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an amazing place to work. Work from home, travel with the team, and surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb. Read about everything we’ve done to make working at Action Verb great.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products requires a great internal infrastructure. We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage. We built our own application deployment system. We self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe in using the right tool for the job. Our core applications are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. We use Rails, React, Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a tool just because “that’s how it’s done around here.”</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that engineers should support what they build. We expect our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they make. If there are performance problems in production, nobody should have to chase anyone down. All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation and all engineers speak to customers.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that open-source only works if companies give back. If you work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at Action Verb, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull request back to the upstream project. And if you build something from scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core products, we want you to release that on GitHub too. We’ll also pay your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves. We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Salary and Pay</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post. We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</div><div><br></div><div>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</div><div><br></div><div>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</div><div><br></div><div>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb, we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work. Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500 Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.</b></div><div><br></div><div>We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don’t trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.</div><div><br></div><div>If you don’t like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus. That should be enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next path. We hope that you won’t take us up on the offer, but we want you to feel good knowing that it’s there.</div><div><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Ready To Apply?</b></div><div><br></div><div>Working here isn’t for everyone, but if you think it might be for you, please apply.</div><div><br></div><div>We only read cover letters in our first screening round, so make sure yours counts.

With an abundance of curiosity, knowledge and skill, it’s your job to move the product forward in search of very happy and productive customers.</p>\n<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being a product designer at Help Scout is a “full stack” role, meaning you see most projects through from idea to production deployment. We do this intentionally, to make sure the voice of the customer is clear throughout the life of a design.</li>\n<li>You’ll learn to finish our customers’ sentences, which means talking to a lot of them, understanding the root of a problem — and all variations of it — prior to starting on a design. You are responsible for crafting solutions that work broadly across our diverse customer base.</li>\n<li>You’ll take product ideas and translate them into a pixel­ perfect experience for customers. You’ll do the user research, create detailed project specs/wireframes, then hand-off working HTML prototypes to the engineering team for development. We’d expect you to be able to do this without any help, even though you’ll get lots of support and feedback from teammates.</li>\n<li>You’ll be working with engineers to make sure the execution of your project is exactly as you intended it. Once a project is almost ready for production, you’ll work with QA and other engineers to test. The rollout plan may involve small beta groups, doing usability testing or conducting a survey, all of which you would run for us.</li>\n<li>You’ll also be working on bugs and refactoring front-end code as needed on an ongoing basis. We typically have cleanup sprints every twelve weeks, but most design bugs are fixed right away.</li>\n<li>In coordination with Jared and Dave, you’ll help out on the growth side of things as the priorities of our small design team shift.</li>\n<li>We’re not big on fancy titles, but this is a senior-level position, both in terms of skills and experience required.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>About you</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have a deep admiration for great products and what specifically makes them excellent. That admiration has led you to a career in product design, and you’ve worked on at least one product you are really proud of.</li>\n<li>When you work on a product, you do so with a deep understanding of how people will interact with it. Insights from people like Kathy Sierra and Steve Krug influence your approach to designing products and doing customer research.</li>\n<li>You have a design (UX/graphic or both) background and understand what goes into making products work from a technical standpoint. You can “talk the talk” enough to get on the same page with an engineer about implementing your design and testing it.</li>\n<li>You can write HTML and CSS. Javascript skills are a bonus. You wouldn’t have any trouble creating a working prototype from a Sketch file.</li>\n<li>You have excellent writing skills. In our remote culture, most team communication takes place in Trello, Slack, GitHub, and Help Scout on a daily basis. As you can see by the above, you’ll be doing a lot of product management and communication, so it’s a very important skill.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"whoyoullworkwith\">Who You’ll Work With</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/itsdavemartin/\">Dave Martin</a>, Design Team Lead - You’ll be reporting to Dave, who co-leads the design team with Jared, and brings a wide range of design, growth, and front-end development experience to the team.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/wjaredmcdaniel/\">Jared McDaniel</a>, Co-­founder and Designer ­- Jared works on all aspects of the brand, including identity, product, content and marketing.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://buzzusborne.com/\">Buzz Usborne</a>, Designer - Buzz is a fellow product designer focused on improving all aspects of the product experience.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jonquach.com/\">Jon Q</a>, Designer - Q (his nickname) spends most of his time coding all the things — prototypes, new features, and <a href=\"http://developer.helpscout.net/seed/\">Seed</a>, a CSS framework he created.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You read that correctly … you’ll be primarily working with four men. But we’re <a href=\"https://www.helpscout.net/blog/diversity-inclusion/\">working really hard to fix that</a>. If you are a woman or member of an underrepresented group, we’d love the opportunity to earn your trust.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutus\">About us</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Help Scout is a remote team with employees in eleven countries (eight people in the Boston office).

We need your help to do it.</strong></p>\n<p>Our clients trust us to take care of them – and their brand – especially when crafting their digital experiences. We believe the combination of curiosity, design, writing, development and a little bit of adventure can create something more than just a website. Our holistic approach allows us to put goals before technology and meaning before jargon.</p>\n<p>The Design Rangers are a small, 4-person design and marketing strategy firm based in sunny Colorado Springs, Colorado, where we play (almost) as hard as we work. We’re celebrating our 10th anniversary this year and proud of our humble basement beginnings.</p>\n<p><strong>WHO IS THE IDEAL DEV RANGER?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone who sees code as art. Art that when combined with strategy, design and content, becomes a masterpiece.</li>\n<li>A designer-turned developer or a developer with an HUGE appreciation for good design</li>\n<li>A willing collaborator who wants to work with a team to make the best experiences possible</li>\n<li>A life-long student</li>\n<li>Someone who likes to laugh and have fun</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>THE RANGER CAMP (OUR CULTURE):</strong></p>\n<p>Below are some of the things we’re all about.\nIf they make you want to lace-up your boots and join the camp, we’d love to hear from you. If not, your adventure lies elsewhere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fun and lively – Our Slack channel makes full use of Giphy. We like to talk, joke, have fun and eat tacos (even on a Monday.)</li>\n<li>Storytellers – We believe every client has a story that will connect them to their audience, and we love discovering it.</li>\n<li>Collaborators – We think together is better.</li>\n<li>Contributors – Free marketing workshops for nonprofits, sharing lessons learned with our competitors, connecting with our community. We want to be part of the conversation.</li>\n<li>Outdoorsy – This is Colorado after all. Several of our clients are based in the outdoor/recreation industry and we’re out in it whenever possible.</li>\n<li>We work with nice people – Because life’s too short to work with jerks.</li>\n<li>Cause related – Nonprofits love us and we love them.</li>\n<li>Honest – We are Rangers, and open and honest communication is part of our DNA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>OUR DESIGN/DEV PHILOSOPHY:</strong></p>\n<p>We’re actively moving away from the linear design-and-dev, templat-and-test approach to creating websites and digital products. Instead, we prefer to create design and dev systems that are flexible from the start. And not only for the end-users or stakeholders, but for the content managers, who are often left to fend for themselves.</p>\n<p>We’ve been watching industry leaders and adding our own Ranger insights to the mix, using atomic design principles and new deliverables like element collages to forge a new path. Don’t know what those things are? You should be looking them up. Currently we’re using tools like Sketch, InVision, WordPress, the X Theme/Pro/Cornerstone framework along with hand-crafted design, code and content to get the job done.</p>\n<p><strong>SKILLS TO PAY THE BILLS:</strong></p>\n<p>======================================</p>\n<p>We believe that passion and willingness to learn can move mountains. But we also need a foundational skillset to build-upon. Here’s what we need you to bring to the table:</p>\n<p><strong>REQUIRED:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Front-end development</strong> – You know, the crafting of HTML, CSS &amp; JS into art like we talked about earlier. Oh, and it’s 2017 for goodness sakes, EVERYTHING has to be responsive.</li>\n<li><strong>Wordpress development</strong> – You don’t need to be a PHP genius, but you do need to understand how basic hooks, actions, logic and structure work. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>WordPress best practices</p></li>\n<li><p>Theme development, child themes and template creation</p></li>\n<li><p>Working with the WP Codex</p></li>\n<li><p>Working with existing frameworks and plugins</p></li>\n<li><p>Creating basic extensions and/or plugins</p></li>\n<li><p>Creating intuitive, user-friendly experiences, even in the back-end</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flexible approach to design and development</strong> – Everyone has their own way of doing things. We need someone who is always willing to experiment and change workflows when and if it makes sense.</li>\n<li><strong>Tenacity</strong> – Dev can be frustrating, trust me, we know. But we need someone who won’t give up. Someone who curses the existence of IE but finds the solution and rises triumphantly nonetheless. #winning</li>\n<li><strong>Detail-oriented</strong> – Sorry, 19px Arial is not close enough to 1.25rem Proxima Nova. You’ll need to be a stickler for all the little details. We all do.</li>\n<li><strong>Thinks beyond the brackets</strong> – Your key skill is code. Our key differentiator is creating great experiences. Creating them requires thinking about the entire solution, not just one piece of it.</li>\n<li><strong>Able to take and give feedback</strong> – Your opinion matters. So does ours. Let’s make great things together!</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>OK with frameworks and gasp even plugins</strong> – Yes, we said the “P” word. We know custom code is always cleaner and faster. Yes, we know frameworks can add additional overhead. We also know that they can jump-start great solutions instead of re-inventing the wheel.</li>\n<li><strong>Basic design principles</strong> – You don’t need to be a designer, but you should be able to see that <a href=\"https://stripe.com/\">Stripe’s website</a> looks a lot better than <a href=\"http://electrifyingtimes.com/\">Electrifying Times</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>A student of life</strong> – We learn something new every day. So should you.</li>\n<li><strong>Problem-solver</strong> – Our clients have challenges. Help us solve them.</li>\n<li><strong>Communication skills</strong> – Be clear. Be concise. And above all else, be human. Bonus points if you can make us laugh.</li>\n<li><strong>Tasks both big and small</strong> – Sometimes we’re creating a site that brings a client to tears. Sometimes plugins need updated. You’ll be responsible for these things and everything in-between.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>NICE TO HAVE:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP skills</li>\n<li>Full-stack skills</li>\n<li>Familiarity with Agile design principles</li>\n<li>Familiarity with Atomic design principles</li>\n<li>Familiarity with GIT versioning</li>\n<li>Web and/or print design skills</li>\n<li>Loves to create a good process</li>\n<li>Up on modern standards/techniques</li>\n<li>Familiar with Sketch, Adobe and InVision products</li>\n<li>UX experience</li>\n<li>Theme and/or plugin development</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>THE JOB:</strong></p>\n<p>======================================</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Crafting code</strong> – Creating digital experiences that foster an environment of success for everyone involved:<ul>\n<li>The end user</li>\n<li>The content managers</li>\n<li>The stakeholder</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>Websites</strong> – Creating websites, from single-page campaign support to full-blown corporate basecamps.</li>\n<li><strong>Design systems</strong> – Creating pattern libraries of design and code that can act as Lego blocks for a brand.</li>\n<li><strong>Surprise-and-delight</strong> – Micro-interactions and small additions that make a big difference.</li>\n<li><strong>Processes</strong> – Building and documenting Ranger-approved ways of working that can be re-used and enhanced over time</li>\n<li><strong>Web maintenance, updates and refinements</strong> – The little stuff that’s critical to keep a site running smoothly.</li>\n<li><strong>Extending and refining existing client sites</strong> – Based on data, behavior and business needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Determining the best dev solutions</strong> – Using a holistic approach that considers the entire experience and all audiences including content managers.</li>\n<li><strong>Support</strong> – Respond to and take action on support tickets and on-going web refinements for clients.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep the Ranger site looking tip-top</strong> – because it tends to get neglected. Like hasn’t been updated in 2+ years neglected.</li>\n<li><strong>Contributing</strong> – to our on-going discussion of how design and dev can help get to the essence of the client’s story.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SPECIFICS:</strong></p>\n<p>======================================</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full-time preferred, part-time with secured hours considered.</li>\n<li>In-office working arrangement preferred but open to a remote working situation.</li>\n<li>We’ll require finalists to take a sample design and dev it. Paid of course, but you can’t BS your way through it.</li>\n<li>We’ll want to know a lot about who you are and if you’re a fit.</li>\n<li>Sell us!
