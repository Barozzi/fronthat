The project should consist of two applications:</div><div><h4>Mini-BookingSync API</h4></div><div>Generate a new Rails application and build REST JSON API with 2 endpoints: Rentals and Bookings with full CRUD. Rental is something that you can book for a particular period of time (like a vacation villa or a hotel) and Booking is a reservation for given Rental for a particular period of time.</div><div>The API should be authenticatable by a token (can be one global hardcoded token, no need for refresh token, expiring tokens etc. this time, keep this part simple).</div><div>Rentals should have :name attribute, <code>daily_rate</code> attribute and should have many bookings. Bookings should have <code>start_at</code> and <code>end_at</code> datetime attributes which indicate the time period of the reservation, <code>client_email</code> attribute, just to know for whom it is supposed to be and :price attribute, which will be the price for this booking.</div><div>Price calculation for the booking should be simple: only <code>daily_rate</code> should be considered when calculating the price. If the rental's daily price is equal to 100, the booking's price for 3 days should be equal to 300, for 5 days it should be 500 etc.</div><div>All attributes for both Rentals and Bookings should be required. Make sure that:</div><ul><li>the dates for bookings don't overlap</li><li>the price for given period is valid when creating a booking</li><li>the reservation should be possible for at least one night / day stay</li></ul><div><h4>Mini-BookingSync API Client</h4></div><div>Generate a new Ember application that would serve as a client of the Mini-BookingSync API. This application should be able to handle all CRUD actions for both Rentals and Bookings endpoints. The essential part of the application would be creating bookings for given rental - a user should be able to pick start at and end at dates, fill in client email, see the price for given period of time and create a booking.</div><div>Treat this assignment it as if you were building a real-world application. If you think some other validations or requirements would make sense from the domain perspective, feel free to add some extra things.</div><div>Don't forget to include a GitHub repository URL(s) in your email. Good luck and see you at the interview!</div><p><br></p><h2>How to Apply</h2><p>Complete the homework (see last section of the job offer description) and please send an email to <a encode=\"hex\" href=\"mailto:jobs@bookingsync.com\">jobs@bookingsync.com</a> telling us about yourself, why do you think you are the best candidate for this role and attach a résumé.

This may include anything from chart-heavy <a href=\"https://www.16personalities.com/country-profiles/germany\">country profiles</a> to simple <a href=\"https://www.16personalities.com/languages\">language lists</a>, with a wide variety of challenges and learning opportunities.</p>\n<p>Sounds interesting? Then please keep reading!</p>\n<h3 id=\"responsibilities\">Responsibilities</h3>\n<p>This is a strictly design role – you won’t need to do any coding, our developers will handle that. Obviously, front-end knowledge is always helpful, just in case there are any technical limitations you need to take into account or any specific measurements you need to pass to the developers, but it’s not critical. Your typical workflow may look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discussing requirements with the lead developer or the research team lead;</li>\n<li>Designing the prototype in InVision or a similar tool;</li>\n<li>Getting feedback on the prototype and making changes if necessary;</li>\n<li>Advising developers during the implementation stage;</li>\n<li>Reviewing the finished page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see by exploring our website, our style and color scheme are pretty well established. We aren’t looking for major overhauls at the moment, so if you’re used to working with significantly different designs, please bear in mind that you’d need to adapt to our approach, at least at first. We’re definitely open to suggestions and gradual improvements, but it’s not a “tear it all down and start from scratch” role.</p>\n<p>We aren’t looking for someone who’s primarily an UX guru rather than a UI designer either. UX knowledge would certainly be a bonus, but right now, we need someone who’d primarily help us design beautiful, modern, and user-friendly interfaces for our assessments, surveys, and various member tools.</p>\n<p>The hourly rate for this position is $50-75, depending on your skills and experience. However, we’re happy to negotiate if you charge more and believe you’d be an exceptional candidate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"experience\">Experience</h3>\n<p>It doesn’t really matter how many years of experience you have under your belt, as long as your portfolio, skills, and work ethic are amazing. As you’re probably well aware, “X years of experience” in this field may also mean “I’ve been building websites with Microsoft Word for years, and I still think blinking and scrolling text is cool”. If you believe you can do a great job here, get in touch with us. We’re looking for the best, and we’ll both compensate you generously and give you plenty of exciting opportunities to prove your skills.</p>\n<p>You must be very familiar with the latest trends in this field, e.g. material design, focus on mobile usability, importance of whitespace etc. We don’t chase trends for the sake of it, but we don’t want to get stale either. We’d like you to help us keep our website modern-looking and easy to use by incorporating emerging UI design trends and principles where that makes sense.</p>\n<p>We’re quite perfectionistic when it comes to our content and tools, so you should have an excellent eye for detail. This point is kind of obvious, but still. Our developers should not be left wondering whether you really wanted the left margin to be 50px smaller than the right one, or whether that was an oversight. Among other things, please mention unicorns somewhere when applying. Just checking your attention to detail.</p>\n<p>You should be highly responsive and available for at least 10-20 hours / week. We certainly don’t expect to be your only client, but if you’re going to be juggling a dozen different projects at once, this position may not be the best fit. Sometimes we may have lots of projects coming through all at once, whereas other times we may go for stretches where we mostly tinker with existing pages while waiting for our research team to finish building a new tool – but we’ll always have something for you to work on.</p>\n<p>Finally, you should have native-level English writing skills. You can live anywhere in the world, that makes no difference at all – however, you need to be able to understand project requirements and communicate with other members without language barriers getting in the way. We use Slack for messaging and don’t do calls, so if you prefer text communication, this should be right up your alley.</p>\n<h3 id=\"process\">Process</h3>\n<p>If you’d like to apply, please send your resume / CV and a link to your portfolio (ideally on Dribbble or a similar service instead of asking us to download an archive from Google Drive, for example) to <a href=\"mailto:join@nerisanalytics.com?subject=[UI%20Designer]\">join@nerisanalytics.com</a>. Please make sure to mention your availability and preferred hourly rate.</p>\n<p>We’ll then pick the most qualified candidates and get in touch with them. The next step will involve testing your skills with a few sample mockups (with you being paid the agreed hourly rate, of course), and we’ll then make the final decision.</p>\n<p>You’ll work on a freelance (non-employee) basis, and the initial contract will be for three months, with a very high likelihood of extension if everything goes well.</p>\n<p>This should be it – thanks, and we look forward to hearing from you! Please do feel free to <a href=\"https://www.16personalities.com/contact-us\">contact us</a> if you have any questions at all.</p>","seo-description":"We’re currently looking for a talented UI designer who’d be able to help us improve existing sections and develop new ones.","timestamp":1507223642883,"prettydate":"5 Oct","category":"design"}},{"type":"jobs","id":"-KvhW30u_seM64KaeucT","attributes":{"title":"Golang / Go Job: Full-stack developer (remote or New York)","url":"https://www.golangprojects.com/golang-go-job-cao-Full-stack-developer-remote-work-possible-New-York-CottageClass.html","company":"CottageClass ","day":"05","month":"10","year":"2017","slugend":"golang-go-job-full-stack-developer-remote-or-new-york","slug":"05/10/2017/golang-go-job-full-stack-developer-remote-or-new-york","description":"<p><strong>About the company</strong></p>\n<p>CottageClass is a community marketplace for childhood education.

You’d need to be able to work independently and produce top-notch illustrations without anyone double-checking your work for misaligned shadows, colors falling outside our style guide, etc. We’re quite perfectionistic when it comes to our content, so you’d really need to have an excellent eye for detail.</p><p>The hourly rate for this position is $50-75, depending on your skills and experience.

You can live anywhere in the world, that makes no difference at all – however, you need to be able to understand complex concepts and communicate with other members without language barriers getting in the way. We use Slack for messaging and don’t do calls, so if you prefer text communication, this should be right up your alley.</p><h2>Process</h2><p>If you’d like to apply, please send a link to your portfolio (ideally on Dribbble or a similar service instead of asking us to download an archive from Google Drive, for example) along with a brief intro message to <a href=\"mailto:join@nerisanalytics.com?subject=[Illustrator]\">join@nerisanalytics.com</a>. Please make sure to mention your availability and preferred hourly rate.</p><p>We’ll then pick the most qualified candidates and get in touch with them. The next step will involve testing your skills with a few sample illustrations (with you being paid the agreed hourly rate, of course), and we’ll then make the final decision.</p><p>You’ll work on a freelance (non-employee) basis, and the initial contract will be for three months, with a very high likelihood of extension if everything goes well.</p><p>This should be it – thanks, and we look forward to hearing from you!

Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.\"<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p>\n<p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p>\n<p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months.

We use Rails, React, Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a tool just because “that’s how it’s done around here.”</p>\n<p><strong>We believe that engineers should support what they build.</strong>&nbsp;We expect our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they make. If there are performance problems in production, nobody should have to chase anyone down. All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation and all engineers speak to customers.</p>\n<p><strong>We believe that open-source only works if companies give back.</strong>&nbsp;If you work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at Action Verb, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull request back to the upstream project. And if you build something from scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core products, we want you to release that on GitHub too. We’ll also pay your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.</p>\n<p><strong>We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.</strong>&nbsp;We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://actionverb.com/core-beliefs\" rel=\"nofollow\">READ THE REST OF OUR CORE BELIEFS<span>→</span></a></p>\n<p><strong>Salary and Pay</strong></p>\n<p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post.&nbsp;<strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p>\n<p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company.

We want your family to be healthy.</p>\n<p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb,&nbsp;<strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong>&nbsp;Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p>\n<p><strong>Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500 Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.</strong></p>\n<p>We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don’t trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.</p>\n<p>If you don’t like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus.

Unlike Dropbox and other storage-focused services, Logikcull’s job is to rip the data apart, dive deep into the analysis, and then present it so that distributed teams with varying levels of technical skill can see the trees through the forest (we also save a lot of trees in the process).</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Doing this at the speed of the web requires massive computing, storage, and an ever expanding infrastructure to support them all. Our challenges are both broad and deep because the data we need is nested in other data. Emails have attachments, word documents wrap human-readable content in formatting data structures and almost anything can be printed to PDF. Our system has to be smart enough to recognize everything in order to unpack it properly, graceful enough to remember complex relationships between documents and fast enough to rip through gigabytes concurrently.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And all of this needs to happen at scale, for all of our customers (in 34 different countries and growing),&nbsp;<strong>within minutes or hours from the first upload</strong>. Insane, right?</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It’s controlled chaos at scale and here’s why:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The technical challenges and opportunities for growth are usually enough to keep a top engineer happy. But it’s the social impact Logikcull is having that spurns our people to keep innovating. For instance, several state and local governments have slashed the lead time needed &nbsp;to turn around open records requests (i.e. FOIA) to&nbsp;<em>days</em>&nbsp;by using Logikcull. Prior to Logikcull, this process used to take weeks, months, and in some cases, years. We believe that information requested through the proper channels should flow freely, and we’re living this every day.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Another example where Logikcull is having an impact on our society is litigation. To us, litigation can be a means to affect positive change (<a href=\"http://logikcull.com/blog/into-the-wild-earthjustice-amanda-sharp/\" rel=\"nofollow\">see this blog post about how Logikcull helped to save an endangered species of wolves</a>) and it allows people of all means to get access to justice. Getting access to justice also means being able to afford litigation. One of the biggest costs to litigation is paying professionals to sift through the data (i.e. discovery or e-discovery). Logikcull uses technology and a carefully designed interface to make this easy, fast, and affordable. &nbsp;This empowers our customers &nbsp;access to justice, and also save a ton of money - in some cases, millions of dollars are saved by using Logikcull. For a business, the cost savings can be pumped back into the business for growth, employee benefits, and more.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is why we do what we do. And the positive team-focused engineering culture at Logikcull makes working on these massive problems even more rewarding. If this is something you would like to be a part of, we’d love to hear from you.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Our current stack includes: Rails, Backbone + Marionette, MySQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch, all running in AWS.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>Job Responsibilities</h3></div><ul>\n<li>You will completely own and build out features in Rails + Javascript from start-to-finish</li>\n<li>You are able to take a design/proposal and carry it through to a thoughtful and polished end result with good test coverage</li>\n<li>You will support our amazing Customer Success team in helping diagnose/explain user-reported bugs and improve existing code</li>\n<li>You will review code written by other engineers and provide useful and honest feedback</li>\n<li>You will take initiative to improve the software whenever you notice something lacking or that is a particular pain point from your use</li>\n<li>You will write documentation around features and operations to help share knowledge and save other developers time</li>\n<li>You will participate in an on call schedule and be open/willing to expand your knowledge of backend systems to keep things operational</li>\n<li>You have the ability to learn and move within the organization as wanted.

Here’s how we do it.</div><div><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>We Practice Holacracy</b></div><div><br></div><div>We are one of the early adopters of Holacracy, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</div><div><br></div><div>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations. As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</div><div><i><br></i></div><div><i>\"Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.\"</i></div><div><i>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</i></div><div><br></div><div>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</div><div><br></div><div>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</div><div><br></div><div>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</div><div><br></div><div>Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</div><div><br></div><div>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</div><div><br></div><div>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Skillset Expectations</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the table:</div><div><br></div><ul>\n<li>Solid web development frontend skills in Javascript, HTML, and CSS, including ES5, JSX, Sass, and React.js.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Experience building and delivering React.js applications that have seen actual production usage.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Familiarity with building classic Ruby on Rails UIs (server-side rendered views) is a strong plus.<br>\n</li>\n<li>A sense of good UX principles (though you will not necessarily be expected to design.

Our best applicants also tend to have at least 3-5 years experience in a position with direct responsibility for developing and supporting large production applications.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Our Core Beliefs</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>We believe that everyone in tt everyone in the company should have programming skills. Our customers are primarily engineers, and in order to relate to them and support our products at the highest possible level, we should all be engineers too.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide variety of programming language experience. We don’t hire for specific programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who are fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be adaptable and ready to evolve to what’s next.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us access to great people we wouldn’t otherwise be able to hire. We tend to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually have their family established somewhere. By offering remote work, we can hire the best people, no matter where they’re located.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an amazing place to work. Work from home, travel with the team, and surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb. Read about everything we’ve done to make working at Action Verb great.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products requires a great internal infrastructure. We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage. We built our own application deployment system. We self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe in using the right tool for the job. Our core applications are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. We use Rails, React, Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a tool just because “that’s how it’s done around here.”</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that engineers should support what they build. We expect our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they make. If there are performance problems in production, nobody should have to chase anyone down. All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation and all engineers speak to customers.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that open-source only works if companies give back. If you work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at Action Verb, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull request back to the upstream project. And if you build something from scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core products, we want you to release that on GitHub too. We’ll also pay your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves. We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Salary and Pay</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post. We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</div><div><br></div><div>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</div><div><br></div><div>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</div><div><br></div><div>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb, we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work. Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500 Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.</b></div><div><br></div><div>We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don’t trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.</div><div><br></div><div>If you don’t like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus. That should be enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next path. We hope that you won’t take us up on the offer, but we want you to feel good knowing that it’s there.</div><div><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Ready To Apply?</b></div><div><br></div><div>Working here isn’t for everyone, but if you think it might be for you, please apply.</div><div><br></div><div>We only read cover letters in our first screening round, so make sure yours counts.
