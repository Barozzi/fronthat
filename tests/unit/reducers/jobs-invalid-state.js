We are looking for senior front-end developers to help shape and take part in the process.\n\n###About us\n\nConferize is on a mission to enable anyone to gather a community, share knowledge and create change. So we’re building a universal and social event solution to help event makers create the biggest impact. Without fuss or big budgets. Why? Because we need to meet.\n\n###How we work\n\nAt Conferize we strive to cultivate a multicultural environment where work, socializing and personal development go hand in hand. We invest in people who are driven and motivated and believe in changing the status quo. We love creative thinkers and selfstarters, who never wait to be told what to do.\n\nWe believe in a flat bottom-up organization of work where culture trumps policy. We have little-to-no 'middle layer', as our team work semi-autonomously and leadership is semi-internalized. We're 100 % product-driven, operating with a zero bug policy and exceptional product design; how things look, how they work and how they're built.\n\nLike us you’re ambitious and professional, yet nice to be around. You have excellent standards for how you communicate and collaborate. We'll give you everything you need to do your absolute best, most creative and challenging work – with the least amount of frustration. Oh, and we never outsource development and we don't work with arbitrary deadlines, because we believe both lead to bad solutions.\n\nOur main office is in Copenhagen and we work with flexible hours. Working remotely is an option if you’re in no more than 1 hour from our main time zone (Central European Time).\n\nWe believe in fewer great people than many average and invest in people who are self-driven.

We are currently using AngularJS, but you'll be responsible for helping transition to a new isomorphic front-end experience based upon React and Redux with a Ruby on Rails backend.\n\n* At least 3 years of Javascript professional experience.\n* At least 1 year of AngularJS, React or similar experience.\n* Proficient understanding of CSS.\n* You care about writing semantic well formed code and paying attention to standards and good practices.\n* Proficient understanding of Git.\n* You're a Mac person.\n\n###Bonus skills\n\n* Experience with Ruby on Rails or similar frameworks.\n* Experience with MongoDB and/or PostgreSQL.\n\n###What we offer\n\n* To be part of an adventure. With a great team of highly motivated and engaged individuals, who are also great team players. We are on an exciting journey towards something big.\n* Option to work with the latest technologies, building a cutting edge product and user experience.\n* Real participation and team work.

From constructing intuitive search to stunning visualizations and making sophisticated reports, AgFlow aims to provide great interfaces for understanding complex agriculture domain in simple steps and making this extracted knowledge easily accessible. Aggregated data by AgFlow is skyrocketing such that new data types are analyzed quarterly, new data sources are acquired weekly in addition to increase in the amount of data from each data source.\n\n###You might work on:\n* The new version of AgFlow's single page application. It's not enough to navigate/analyze rich set of data in terms of intuitiveness, responsiveness and supported browsers\n* Mobile application. In trading, having correct information timely is vital so our users should be able to access platform with their mobile devices.\n* Widgets. AgFlow has powerful backend system to crunch huge amount of data to summarize multiple complex parameters to a few simple numbers. Goal is to make this inference pluggable into different places.\n* Vast array of internal tools, including AgFlow admin, used across teams to manage/investigate price, trade flow, freight data, and AgFlow inference, where AgFlows go to learn about high level inferences, domain coverage and quality of comparisons to predictions/actual government numbers.\n###You might be a fit for this role if you:\n* Can empathize with the many different types of users who use AgFlow’s UIs\n* Enjoy building UIs with modern tools like ES6, React, Redux, PostCSS, Flow, and Webpack\n* Can think through quickly changing customer requirements to come up with high-impact ways of quickly solving their problems\n* Care deeply about performance, accessibility, and API design\n* Have a high bar for quality of code and quality of user experience\n* Are comfortable working in a large frontend codebase with many stakeholders\n* Care about the details\n###What's it like to work at AgFlow\nAgFlow is helping to make agricultural knowledge online, understandable and to be easily acted on. This domain's very similar to credit card business where there are a few companies, whom everybody is afraid to compete with, On the other hand, they are highly inefficient and very expensive. AgFlow disrupts this domain by making it efficient and relatively very cheap.\n\nAgFlow is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core agriculture market knowledge, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills and backgrounds - from reliably handling of acquisition of data from different mediums (API, CSV, EXCEL, PDF, HTML scraping), cleaning and normalizing data into one carefully designed model, making inferences by learning from it and creating interfaces to enable everybody to take knowledgeable decision in the market.\n\nDue to domain complexity, AgFlow is working with multiple domain experts. Developers are always in contact to discuss ins and outs of each feature with them. This benefits developers to learn details of trade and agriculture.\n\nWe use a lot of open source projects but unfortunately we can't contribute back as much as we want due to limitation of resources but you can be a part of change in this direction.\n\nWe look at AgFlow as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.\n\nWe encourage all engineers to transition teams to take short-term projects or to take personal initiatives to connect data sources creatively. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of AgFlow work while also establishing stronger ties and cross pollination between groups.\n\nWe want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other AgFlows in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do). We also have a culture of transparency that we care with utmost priority.\n\n###You should include these in your application:\n* A short introduction describing who you are and what you’re looking for. What projects have you enjoyed working on? Which have you disliked? What motivates you?\n* Links to online profiles you use (GitHub, Stackoverflow, Twitter, etc).\n* A description of your work history (whether as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose).\n\nOur culture and this write-up are inspired by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)\n###How to apply\n\n[jobs@agflow.com](mailto:jobs@agflow.com)","seo-description":"AgFlow is hiring a Frontend Developer.","prettydate":"10 May"}},{"type":"jobs","id":"-Kjy3pDRsCpiS2mW7NeF","attributes":{"title":"Product Designer","url":"https://www.ziprecruiter.com/jobs/elmington-property-management-e8d883dc/product-designer-4034e74e","company":"Elmington Property Management","day":"12","month":"05","year":"2017","slugend":"product-designer","slug":"12/05/2017/product-designer","description":"Elmington Technology is a property management software technology firm based in Nashville, TN.

When we boot-strapped Edgar in mid-2014 it quickly became profitable and now has 1000s of happy, beautiful, paying customers. We want your help to do it all over again.\n\nIt’s a greenfield project (yay!), so you’ll be instrumental in making the technical decisions of how it all comes together, working in a pure React/Redux environment.\n\nYou’ll be joining a small team of talented developers, and working alongside dedicated UX designers, QA and Customer Experience pros.\n\nOur stack is a React/Redux front end, consuming an Elixir/Phoenix back end hosted on Google Cloud. It’s great stack to work with everyday, and we take our time to write solid code and proper tests to make sure it stays that way.\n\n###Dev Process\nWe do a fair amount of pair programming and a lot of code reviews, we love solid tests and continuous integration, and we deploy several times a week. Basically? We’re constantly improving our process so we can create an ideal developer environment - low overheads, high transparency. Estimates were inaccurate and irrelevant, so we dropped ‘em. Artificial deadlines weren’t doing it for us, so we switched from scrum to pure kanban and never looked back. When something isn’t working, we’re not afraid to throw it out and try something new - so if you have exciting ideas about the dev process and how to make your own job even better, you’ll fit right in. (We’re open-minded like that.)\n\nYou’ll have final responsibility for the solutions you build, from inception all the way through to deployment, so your teammates know exactly who to shower with praise when you ship to production.\n\n###About Us\nWe’re a small team of about 30 people, all working remotely across the US & Canada. We do a lot of collaborating and meme-swapping on Slack, along with virtual team meetings and super-futuristic video calls. We also do a twice-annual meetup week where we work together on cool projects all day and generally make fools of ourselves all night. We’re proudly bootstrapped and profitable, which means we get to turn down VC money a lot and keep doing things the way we like. We’re pretty serious about building and maintaining an awesome, positive company culture, so, you know, no jerks.\n\nWe'll probably get along if you’re someone who wants to be creative, have a pretty-serious-but-not-inhuman amount of responsibility, and work with people who make going to work not suck. (And be one of those people yourself. We like those people.)\n\nWe know we’re ridiculously lucky to have this crack squad of ambitious, kind, independent little nerds, and we want to keep that going by bringing in even more people who love geeking out about what they do and doing work they’ll be super proud of. (And on that note, we’re an equal-opportunity employer genuinely committed to building a diverse team, and to fostering the type of inclusive environment in which diversity thrives.)\n\nYou can find out more at [http://meetedgar.com/careers/](http://meetedgar.com/careers/)\n\n###Requirements\n* Senior level developer w/ at least 3 years experience\n* You’ve got real professional experience with React + Redux, and ES6 is a big plus\n* You know how to consume a REST API\n* Experience creating single page applications\n* Startup or \"greenfield\" experience is a big plus\n* Live anywhere in the USA or Canada (must be able to provide documentation of eligibility to work in the USA)\n* You love JS and React\n* You know how to communicate effectively and work as part of a team trying to build something great\n* Passionate about improving the dev process and recognize the value of an awesome company culture\n* Not a jerk\n\n###Perks & Benefits\n* Work from home (or wherever there’s strong wifi)\n* 4 weeks paid vacation (Shazam!

In the past year our Professional Services teams have completed a variety of projects including building the SaaS platform for an award winning energy services asset management startup, building a set of citizen science mobile monitoring apps, building a new way to share environmental monitoring data, building a sophisticated automated data quality control pipeline for the forest sector, creating a portal for biodiversity monitoring data, and delivering a series of applications to support the Fort McMurray wildfire recovery.  Helping us build and expand this core service area will be your primary responsibility.  \n\nOur second business line is in the adaption to climate change space.  Tesera has worked with a key industry associations to build a risk assessment tool that will support and assist municipalities in discovering asset vulnerabilities.  Tesera is commercializing this product which employs a spatial machine learning approach.  We break the landscape down into thousands of spatial indicators which can then be modeled to determine their influence on event outcomes such as infrastructure failures.  We have a lot of work to do here to bring this to a commercial product offering and we are very excited about doing it.  \n\nHigh Resolution Inventory Service  (HRIS) is our third business area.  HRIS enables our clients who manage landscapes to have a higher level of resolution and accuracy that they’ve ever had before.  HRIS combines LiDAR, colour infrared imagery, climate indices, terrain indices and ground plot data via machine learning processes to predict attributes about the landscape.  The types of information that can be generated from HRIS are far-ranging from types and quality of timber resources to locations of streams, potential wildlife habitat and amount of carbon sequestration.  The HRIS solution, creates attributes across an entire landscape creating an inventory that has more useful attributes and is at a more detailed resolution than other approaches available today.  \n\n**OUR “PURPOSE” and** VALUES:\n\n**“We disrupt conventional thinking to expand what is possible.   We ignite change in the future we share.”**\n\n**Accountability:**  We hold ourselves, and each other accountable for all we do.\n\n**Communication:**  We communicate openly and honestly. We listen.

For eight straight years after opening our law firm we grew gross revenues 40% a year until well, we didn't. During this same eight-year period, we grew our payroll at about 40% to handle the increased volume. I told myself during this youthful time I was being a shrewd business owner and the reason I wasn't personally more financially successful was because I\n\nwas reinvesting the revenues into the business. The truth was I mistakenly thought growth would fix all our problems. In 2012 I woke up after seeing revenues significantly decline, not having enough money to routinely pay myself, and quickly realized our lack of systems was the real chokehold on our success.\n\nWith seven offices handling multiple practice areas I worked at a level of complexity that was exhausting. It isn't accurate to say our firm was without systems, but in 2012 we felt like a body builder who is all upper body with tiny legs. Our muscle was a well-developed marketing strategy, and our legs were the systems that supported the firm.\n\nIt took us two years to shore up our infrastructure with deep practice, expert advice, and solutions we borrowed from other industries. We attended multiple guru events, hired numerous consultants, and our audible business library grew quite large. What we learned was to fall in love with the process of systematizing. Why else write this? We love it. 80/20 is what it's all about. Getting a disproportionate return on your investment should be the reward of every improvement.\n\nWe continue to get guidance from several experts and do not claim to have all the answers. We share numbers with other law firms across the country and are committed to progress, not perfection. Asked if I want to grow like we did before, I would say no. Marketing and infrastructure go hand in hand. At whatever speed you can grow both together, make it happen. Disciplined Practices is about doing the right stuff consistently that continually builds momentum.\n\n\n  ","seo-description":"4iiz is seeking a front end UI developer","prettydate":"27 Apr"}},{"type":"jobs","id":"-KikSfyvm5sxn_Ioz7WV","attributes":{"title":"Front-End Developer (EU)","url":"http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/141531/front-end-developer-requirement-european-greenpeace","company":"Greenpeace","day":"27","month":"04","year":"2017","slugend":"front-end-developer-eu","slug":"27/04/2017/front-end-developer-eu","description":"###Job Description\n\n**This is a long term (3 months to 1 year) contract for 40 hours/week work.

As a designer, you’d work closely with product managers, engineers, and sales staff to develop solutions to users’ problems using primarily the web, iOS, and Android.\n\nYou’d be responsible for providing iterative design direction, including visual design (wireframes and mockups) user testing and detailed description of users’ workflow and interactions with Ushahidi.\n\n\n###Responsibilities\n\n* Collaborate with product, engineering, and sales staff to scope, prototype, design, build, user test, and release software and communication material to users.\n* Communicate design direction for solving users’ problems from concept to implementation.\n* Lead the development and implementation of Ushahidi’s design systems, including those used in products and marketing collateral.\n* Lead user testing process, from low-fidelity testing early in the design process, to high-fidelity tests to improve already-built features.\n* Manage the brand and all creative assets of Ushahidi Inc.\n\n###Why you should apply\n\nYou are a thoughtful, creative product designer with a few years of work experience and an interest in international development and social justice. After hacking away at your own projects and/or busting your chops for a while in the corporate world and startups, you’re looking to use your skills to develop software that has a tangible social good.\n\nNew cultures, people and experiences give you energy; you work effectively and efficiently on distributed teams with diverse experience across many time zones. Given the freedom to work anywhere, you are self-guided and can work autonomously. You bring empathy and effective communication to you day to day work. Chaos gives you joy, order is your satisfaction.\n\nWe strongly encourage people from traditionally underrepresented populations in tech - such as women, People of Color, People with Disabilities, and LGBTQ+ people, etc - to apply!\n\n\n\n###Requirements\n\n\n\n###Minimum qualifications\n\n* A portfolio that demonstrates examples of thoughtful and well-executed product design.\n* Ability to present your work, as well as articulate and receive written and verbal feedback.\n* Experience with designing responsive web pages and adaptive iOS and Android applications.\n* Comfortable working in a global team committed to remote collaboration, across time zones.\n* Confident, productive, and comfortable working with autonomy.\n* Solid understanding of HTML and CSS (including Sass).\n* Experience with Git and GitHub workflows.\n* Experience doing UX studies and using user-centric design practices to design products\n* Experience with the design thinking process including effective ideation, prototyping, user feedback and implementation.\n###Preferred qualifications\n\n* Experience writing complex, custom JavaScript to support (and demonstrate) progressively-enhanced user interactions on the web.\n* Experience maintaining and extending a front-end design system or style guide.\n* Experience designing in an agile software development environment\n* Familiarity with AngularJS.\n* Background in graphic design or other visual design field\n\n\n###Benefits\n\n###About Ushahidi\n\nUshahidi started as an ad-hoc group of Kenyan bloggers hammering out code in a couple of days from various locations, trying to figure out a way to gather more and better information about the 2008 post-election violence in Kenya. We have since grown to be a global organization with over 30 staff in seven different countries.\n\nUshahidi is a non-profit technology company that builds open source platforms to help citizens, journalists, organizations, governments, and others gather, manage, analyze, and visualize crowdsourced data. Our tools have been used by hundreds of thousands of individuals and organizations fighting for social causes in over 159 countries — whether for monitoring corruption in Zimbabwe, gathering real-time data on local poverty issues, or giving people a voice in the Syrian crisis.\n\nEveryone at Ushahidi comes to work here because we know that every day people around the world use the tools we build to improve the lives of millions. In other words, in the fight for a better world we are the Q to the 007s out there.\n\nOur team tends to think big and rewards creativity and an entrepreneurial attitude. Over the past six years, we have also built the iHub – the tech community hub in Nairobi, the BRCK – a redesign of connectivity for the developing world, and other projects like Savannah Fund, AfriLabs, and Crisis Mappers. Our ethos – we don’t just build products, we solve problems.\n\n###Why You Might Be A Good Fit\n\n* Independence. The team agrees upon goals, but how they are accomplished is left largely up to the individuals. Nobody will be leaning over your shoulder telling you what to do everyday, we expect you to be able to do that yourself.\n* Team oriented. Desire to work with and support other developers in the team. We rely on team members to support each other, review each others code, and generally help each other keep winning.\n* Intrinsically motivated. Ushahidi came from Nairobi, but team members work all around the world. If all you need is a crazy a cool project, wifi, and coffee (or tea), then you’ll fit right in.\n* Ability to get things done and ship. We’d love you to write beautiful elegant code every time but getting things done matters. You’ll need to pick the right balance between doing it right and doing it fast.\n* Empathy and an interest in helping our user. A desire to work with the community and customers, dig into their use cases, and help them solve problems.\n###Why You Might Not Be A Good Fit\n\n* We pay competitively at Ushahidi, however, keep in mind that we are a mission driven non-profit.\n* You only want to wear one hat. Ushahidi is growing (25+ employees) but we take on the goals of much larger organizations. In practice this means that all Ushahidians end up wearing multiple hats and working on multiple projects. If that excites you, great! If you are set on never venturing out of your job title, you’re going to get frustrated fast.\n* You want to be in an office surrounded by colleagues. You will most likely be operating on your own unless you are based in Nairobi, where about half our team is based. If you need to come into an office and talk to your boss everyday to stay motivated, this job is not for you. Also, we give flexibility and also ask for flexibility to work with different time zones, so you’ll need to be comfortable taking meetings at odd hours.\n###Why working at Ushahidi is awesome\n\n* Open culture: Ushahidi is a place where you can be your full self and contribute in the way that’s best for you. We distribute decisions to the people who do the work, so you own what you do. And our culture is constantly evolving, with self-defined teams deliberately readjusting four times a year.\n* We reward taking risks. Ushahidi works on the bleeding edge of technology for social change, that means taking risks with our efforts. We celebrate swinging for the fences, regardless of the outcome.\n* Our goal in hiring is to find great people first, great skills second.\n* We don’t care where you live. As long as you have Internet access, live wherever you want. Ushahidi team members currently live all over the world: from Japan and New Zealand, to Nairobi and San Francisco.\n* We don’t care when you work. There are no “business hours” at Ushahidi, we are milestone based, not a sit-in-your-chair from 9 to 5 company.\n* Quality of life. Ushahidi is a place you can be your full self. Ushahidi attracts workaholics, so we all work hard to make sure everyone has a work-life balance.\n* Benefits. Take what you want vacation policy (Minimum 25 days a year), parental leave, allowance for health insurance, allowance for a co-working space.\n* We use a transparent [pay calculator](https://www.ushahidi.com/blog/2017/04/04/working-at-ushahidi-pay-equity-and-creating-a-process-of-transparency-and-inclusion) to determine your salary and to be fair and unbiased.","seo-description":"Ushahidi is looking for a designer to lead the direction of its users’ experience and design systems.","prettydate":"19 Apr"}},{"type":"jobs","id":"-Ki6A0qLCGTi9jWaZMLm","attributes":{"title":"Front-end Developer","url":"http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/135796/front-end-developer-creative-market","company":"Creative Market","day":"19","month":"04","year":"2017","slugend":"front-end-developer","slug":"19/04/2017/front-end-developer","description":"###Job Description\n\nHelp independent creators make a living doing what they love!

Our vision is to transform how SaaS tools and infrastructure are bought and sold.\n\nChoosing SaaS and cloud infrastructure tools is difficult. If you’re a developer looking for a hosting solution, you have hundreds of options and no clear way to sift through them all. We’ve built a community of developers, engineers, CTOs, and VPEs that recommend, review, and share their technology stacks. They have significant buying power and a need for tooling and infrastructure services, from startups to large enterprises. The options they have are confusing and increasing in number by the day - they’re desperate to get help choosing the right solutions. StackShare lets technologists see all the best tools and services, who’s using them, and why.\n\n####OUR TEAM:\n\nWe’re a small distributed team of five, with our main office in San Francisco, CA. We believe every member of the team should own the products they build and have a say in what gets built.\n\nOur CEO, Yonas has seen Fortune 500 companies use Gartner PDF reports to make software buying decisions when he worked at Accenture; he’s also seen startups make these decisions after joining a YC-backed startup, where he worked on product design and marketing. Yonas then took StackShare through the 500 Startups accelerator and has been leading our growth and marketing efforts. You'll be working directly with Yonas on a daily basis as part of your role.\n\nThe rest of our team comes from companies like Digital Ocean and Citrix.\n\n####YOU:\n\nAs Front-End Engineer, you will influence everything you see on StackShare. You'll help to shape how hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions of developers and engineers build software.\n\nYou have experience building web applications with at least two years of experience using Rails in a production environment, and at least two years using a JavaScript MVC framework (React experience is a major plus). You have experience building APIs. You hate bureaucracies and want to work at an early stage company that has very little processes. You’re comfortable taking the initiative and just building products that you want to use. As an engineer, you should love using StackShare and if you don’t, you should be excited about making it better.\n\nYou’re comfortable working on something different every day as priorities shift. You view engineering as your strongest skill but you're open to doing whatever the company needs including blog posts, customer support, and email copy. You enjoy shipping code and you believe every new feature should be treated as an experiment and measured closely, and you have the experience to prove it. You build with the following in mind: make it work ➤ make it right ➤ make it fast.\n\n**Bonus Points:**\n\n* You’ve got a good eye for design and UX.\n* You’re a StackShare user (include your profile URL in your application).\n* You’re familiar with almost every tool and service in StackShare’s stack ([http://stackshare.io/stackshare](http://stackshare.io/stackshare)).\n* You’re a tools geek; you sign up for new tools and services just to kick the tires and satisfy your curiosity.\n  ","seo-description":"We’re a small distributed team of five, with our main office in San Francisco, CA.

I am the Creative Director. Part of this process includes what we consider LIGHT customization of a theme boilerplate/framework we developed. We do a minimum of 60-100 of these projects a year, so this would be great ongoing work if you are looking to fill in some serious gaps in your schedule. It is also somewhat seasonal work, we are about to get flooded now, in April 2017 and that will carry through much of summer and we sometimes get another burst in October.\n\nI will be straight with you, as I said this is LIGHT customization. This is most likely NOT work you will be using to boost your portfolio. Not to say it's ugly and half-assed - we want to make it as beautiful as possible within time constraints. But it's not like you're doing big heavy custom design work for Nike or something here. Most of these projects have TIGHT turnarounds and at peak times it's not unusual for us to turn out 8-10 in a week.\n\n**Some Details:**\n\nGood working knowledge of HTML/CSS/LESS. A good eye/sense for aesthetics. Ability to \"Design in the Browser\" IS A MUST. We are not looking for static proofs done in sketch or photoshop. When these are presented to the client they are proofed right in the browser. This light customization does not justify an entire discovery and design process done in raster. I don't care if you're the Paul Rand of static web design compositions, you must know the basics with front-end code. With that, an understanding of responsive web design is good to have.\n\nLight PHP knowledge is a plus. We won't be asking you to develop anything but if you can work your way around a basic if/else statement, that's going to be about the most you might ever need.\n\nFamiliarity with bootstrap is a plus. Our boilerplate theme we start from is based upon it for speedy prototyping and building.\n\nAbilities to manipulate textures/graphics in photoshop or your graphics program of choice for use on the website. Most of the customization that is happening is usually backgrounds in areas on the home page, header and footer to give sites a little personal touch.\n\nTypography and font selection/pairing is important to have. We generally utilize Google fonts but will open up to other open source fonts too like whatever is on fontsquirrel. Rarely do we use anything not open source font-wise though so knowing those services is helpful.\n\nPlease be a **real** person we interact with directly, not an agency sales person or chop shop. English fluent. Please be available/responsive on some kind of chat service, prefer slack but hangouts is okay too. You can be in any timezone but having chat is required.\n\nGit (bitbucket) know-how is a plus but not required.\n\nA sense of humor is always a plus.\n\n**Getting Paid:**\n\nIt's been implied from the beginning but... Speed. Speed. Speed. We aren't looking to burn someone out, we pay fairly/quickly and treat our freelancers very well but it is fast turnaround work and it's not very deep. Literally if you can set a background-image in CSS/LESS, you're nearly there. So your availability will be key as well especially in our peak seasons I described in the first paragraph. We have some freelancers who have been with us for over 10 years and I used to be one too. We definitely like our freelancers.\n\nRates will depend a bit on your experience. We would prefer you come with an hourly rate in mind but we don't nickel and dime. We will either be able to afford you or we won't, we're not going to jerk you around and then not pay. It's all on the up and up, there is paperwork drawn and agreements for everyone here. All very official-like. We obviously have a bottom line to watch like any business but if you come with all these tools and more, we will make it worth your while.\n\n**How to:**\n\nJust drop a reply here or message me if you are interested or have questions. I'll be looking for some kind of portfolio and a resume as well at your general rate info. We are looking pretty immediately for a person to jump in here as we are on the cusp of our busiest time of year.\n  ","seo-description":"We do a minimum of 60-100 of these projects a year, so this would be great ongoing work if you are looking to fill in some serious gaps in your schedule.","prettydate":"30 Mar"}},{"type":"jobs","id":"-KgVe0fneawNOzaDIf3E","attributes":{"title":"Frontend Engineer","url":"http://neuvoo.com/view/?lang=en&k=frontend+remote&l=&f=&p=1&r=40&duc=&v=&source=neuvoosearch&id=6rqj7z2qk0","company":"TVbeat ","day":"30","month":"03","year":"2017","slugend":"frontend-engineer","slug":"30/03/2017/frontend-engineer","description":"At TVbeat, we believe that the way that TV audience measurement and advertising is done today could be improved.

Meta, right?\n\nDribbble's on a mission to support designers in furthering their craft and their career. Dribbble has grown to become (to our own surprise, sometimes) the internet's best place for designers to share work, get inspiration, get hired, and become part of the design community. But we're not satisfied yet. There's a lot we want to do to make things better --- we need a designer that will help us help the design community.\n\nIs that something you're interested in? As Senior Product Designer, you'll be joining a pretty cool team of designers, developers, and community supporters of diverse backgrounds (even some Canadians!) that's looking forward to having a new pair of hands to make good stuff happen.\n\nYou'll be responsible for keeping the needs of the business in mind while serving up lovely user experiences. That means knowing the community inside and out, communicating user needs to the rest of the team, establishing timelines, crafting a consistent look and feel, and generally approaching design problems with thoughtful energy.\n\nWe're a remote crew and we're spread all across this great land. We get together IRL a few times a year, but mostly we enjoy each other's company over Slack and video calls. If you live in Canada or the United States (and are cool and talented), you can join the team without worrying about relocating.\n\nBut that's not all, of course. We've got some truly excellent perks:\n\n* Equipment funds so you have the tools you need to do good work.\n* Money to cover education (books, conferences, courses, whatever!) so you can soak up new ideas and skills.\n* Dog-friendly culture (also cats, ferrets, reptiles, birds, human children, whatever you keep around the house really).\n* Monthly coffee budget so you can live out your remote worker + coffee shop dreams.\n####REQUIREMENTS\n\nSound good to you? Apply with 3 things: your Dribbble username, samples of your work, and a letter about why Dribbble is the right place for you.\n\nMake sure you show us you have:\n\n* Great visual chops and a focus on simple, clear, responsive UI.\n* Ownership: the Dribbble community will depend on you to deliver a quality experience. You feel responsible for creating an excellent, end-to-end platform that supports the needs of our users.\n* Comfort with data: you know when you don't know enough to make a design decision, and you seek out answers.\n* An interest in exploration: you think about what to build now and what to build in the future.\n* A solid perspective on how users engage with online communities.\n* Made useful prototypes and wireframes (send us samples!) and experience working with style guides.\n* A way with icons or illustration.\n* 5+ years of professional product design experience.\n* Worked remote or want to give it a shot.\n* Used Dribbble and been active in the community. That's not to say you've got to be famous, but we need someone who knows and loves (or at least likes) what we do.\n\n\nReach out to [careers@dribbble.com](mailto:careers@dribbble.com) if you have questions. We can't wait to learn more about you.\n  ","seo-description":"We're a remote crew and we're spread all across this great land.

Our product has complicated UX problems, and we’re looking for frontend problem solvers to help us build interfaces that our customers love.\n\n####Why this job matters:\n\nMany frontend developers & designers prefer working at B2C companies rather than B2B for various reasons, and we totally acknowledge that frontend opportunities at B2B are generally considered less attractive than at B2C. However, RankScience is obsessed with our customer happiness. We want our customers to have an even better experience with us than with any typical consumer app with tons of great frontend engineering and design. This job matters because we want to find frontend developer/designer hybrids who are as obsessed with making customers love us as we are.
